Overview
--------
Intelligent Help Desk focuses on efficiently solving customer issues submitted in the form of ticket. We built a help desk where a user/client can createa a ticket with his issue and submit it. An agent or admin will be able to see all the tickets that have been created by the user. Agents and admins will get to open a new dashboard window which contains all the check list items related to the issue. As soon as an agent or an admin tries a checklist item, they submit it. When the other agents look into the ticket, it will be visible that the checklist item submitted previously has already been performed and the agent can go on with the other unchecked items. This in turn saves time and hugely readuces the cost for any organization.

Technologies Used:
We have created a REST server that connects to MySql Server to perform CRUD operations. AngularJs is used to present the data and also submit the form data from the front end.
